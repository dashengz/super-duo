### Project Description:
Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Project
Functionality implementation and UI/UX improvement based on two existing apps

**Football Scores:** An app that helps users keep track of scores of the current football matches.
It uses data obtained from [football-data](http://api.football-data.org/index) API.
It also provides the users with a collection widget.

**Alexandria:** An app where users can document the books they've read.
It can record a book by searching for its ISBN number or scan the barcode.

The UI of the apps are modified to be accessible to all users.

### How to Use:
To use the **Football Scores** app, you'll need to acquire an API_KEY from [this website](http://api.football-data.org/index).

Insert the API_KEY to /.gradle/gradle.properties
